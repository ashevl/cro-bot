# crobot - a Twitter bot
This project is a Twitter bot which provides information about newly-formed companies in Ireland. 
The bot is written in Python and is being run from my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. It uses the API provided by the Companies Registration Office.
The tweets provide the company name, number, reg. date, and a link to the company's location in Google Maps.

The bot can be found here: https://www.twitter.com/cro_bot_ireland
