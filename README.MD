# crobot - a Twitter bot
This project is a Twitter bot which provides information about newly-formed companies in Ireland. 
The bot is written in Python and is being run from my Taspberry Pi 3 Model B.
The tweets provide the company name, number, re. date, and a link to its location in Google Maps.
